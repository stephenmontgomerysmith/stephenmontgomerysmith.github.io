A one-directional dynamic model of a Stewart Platform
was developed to assist NASA in analyzing the dynamic response in
spacecraft docking operations. A simplified mechanical drawing was
created, capturing the physical structure's main features. A simplified
schematic diagram was developed into a lumped mass model from the
mechanical drawing. Three differential equations were derived
according to the schematic diagram. A Simulink diagram was created
using MATLAB to represent the three equations. System parameters,
including spring constants and masses, are derived in detail from the
physical system. The model can be used for further analysis via
computer simulation in predicting dynamic response in its main
docking direction, i.e., up-and-down motion.

We are seeking a physical simulator of a vehicle driven on the
surface of a celestial body. This will be added to a virtual reality
simulation. We desire that the motion of the simulator be so that
the acceleration forces experienced by the vestibular system are
similar to if the crew member were to actually drive the vehicle on
the surface of the celestial body. But the simulator is constrained,
first in its position in that it cannot travel far, and second in its
orientation in that it must approximately face the same direction.

<I>Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, Volume 313, March 2023, article 105001.</I>
This paper is concerned with difficulties encountered by engineers when they attempt to predict the orientation of fibers in the creation of injection molded plastic parts.  It is known that Jeffery's equation, which was designed to model a single fiber in an infinite fluid, breaks down very badly when applied, with no modifications, to this situation.  In a previous paper, the author described how interactions between the fiber orientation and the viscosity of the suspension might cause instability, which could result in the simple predictions from Jeffery's equation being badly wrong.  In this paper, we give some rigorous proofs of instability using Floquet Theory.  We also show that to obtain exponential instability, it is insufficient to consider only two dimensions, although linear instability is still possible.

Understanding the atomic structure of ultrathin (&lt;20 nm) atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings is critical to establish structure property relationships and accelerate the application of ALD films to stabilize battery interfaces. Previous studies have measured the atomic structure of nanoscale ALD films using cryogenic electron diffraction with a large (~200 nm) beam diameter. However, for ultrathin ALD coatings, these measurements provide only ensemble average structural information and cannot be used to directly measure differences in atomic structure through the depth of the ALD film. In this study, we localize the electron beam to a small (~ 5 nm) spot size using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and we collect electron diffraction data at multiple points along the depth of a 12 nm thick ALD AlOx film deposited onto a CNT substrate without a contribution from the substrate. We couple these diffraction measurements with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and iterative reverse Monte Carlo-molecular statics (RMC-MS) modeling to compare atomic structure metrics at different positions in the film depth. We interpret the modeling results considering the 3D concentric cylindrical sample geometry of a CNT with uniform AlOx coating. These measurements confirm a two-phase bulk/interface structural model proposed previously for ALD AlOx and indicate that the interfacial layer at the CNT-AlOx interface is 2.5 nm thick - five times larger than previously reported. This report demonstrates direct measurement of atomic structural variations across nanoscale material interfaces that is of broad interest for electrochemical applications and will help inform the use of ALD coatings to stabilize lithium-ion battery interfaces.

We introduce the notion of the Lie derivative in the context of dual quaternions that represent rigid motions and twists.  First we define the wrench in terms of dual quaternions.  Then we show how the Lie derivative helps understand how actuators affect an end effector in parallel robots, and make it explicit in the two cases case of Stewart Platforms, and cable-driven parallel robots.  We also show how to use Lie derivatives with the Newton-Raphson Method to solve the forward kinematic problem for over constrained parallel actuators.  Finally, we derive the equations of motion of the end effector in dual quaternion form, which include the effect of inertia from the actuators.

We give a formula for \(f(\eta)\), where \(f :\mathbb C \to \mathbb C\) is a continuously differentiable function satisfying \(f(\bar z) = \overline{f(z)}\), and \(\eta\) is a dual quaternion.  Note this formula is straightforward or well known if \(\eta\) is merely a dual number or a quaternion.  If one is willing to prove the result only when \(f\) is a polynomial, then the methods of this paper are elementary.

We describe a particular control method for a system controlled by several actuators with the same control constants.  We show under certain assumptions that the control constants for the whole system can be obtained immediately from the control constants for a single actuator.  This greatly simplifies the work in finding the control constants.  Also, no gain scheduling is required.  The authors have been unable to find any prior work in this direction, and so believe this is a rather new approach.

<I>Preprint.</I>
Following the work of Lloyd Shapley on the Shapley value, and tangentially the work of Guillermo Owen, we offer an alternative non-probabilistic formulation of part of the work of Robert J. Weber in his 1978 paper "Probabilistic values for games."  Specifically, we focus upon efficient but not symmetric allocations of value for cooperative games. We retain standard efficiency and linearity, and offer an alternative condition, "reasonableness," to replace the other usual axioms. In the pursuit of the result, we discover properties of the linear maps that describe the allocations. This culminates in a special class of games for which any other map that is "reasonable, efficient" can be written as a convex combination of members of this special class of allocations, via an application of the Krein-Milman theorem.

<I>Journal of Enhanced Heat Transfer, 22 (6): 485-502 (2015).</I>
Effects of initial conditions on the oscillatory flow in oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) are investigated numerically. Initial vapor temperature, pressure and liquid displacement are in consideration. Three test cases are solved with different initial condition settings. Liquid displacement and vapor temperature tendencies are compared to find which initial condition lead to the best heat transfer performance in all test cases. Fast Fourier transform is employed to calculate the frequency based on liquid displacement. The results show that initial condition has significant effect on oscillating heat pipe performance and keeping initial condition uniform is an effective way for heat transfer enhancement of the system.

Microbial populations adapt to their environment by acquiring advantageous mutations, but in the early twentieth century, questions about how these organisms acquire mutations arose. The experiment of Salvador Luria and Max Delbr&uuml;ck that won them a Nobel Prize in 1969 confirmed that mutations don't occur out of necessity, but instead can occur many generations before there is a selective advantage, and thus organisms follow Darwinian evolution instead of Lamarckian. Since then, new areas of research involving microbial evolution have spawned as a result of their experiment. Determining the mutation rate of a cell is one such area. Probability distributions that determine the number of mutants in a large population have been derived by D. E. Lea, C. A. Coulson, and J. B. S. Haldane. However, not much work has been done when time of cell division is dependent on the cell age, and even less so when cell division is asymmetric, which is the case in most microbial populations. Using probability generating function methods, we rigorously construct a probability distribution for the cell population size given a life-span distribution for both mother and daughter cells, and then determine its asymptotic growth rate. We use this to construct a probability distribution for the number of mutants in a large cell population, which can be used with likelihood methods to estimate the cell mutation rate.

This paper calculates probability distributions modeling the Luria-Delbr&uuml;ck experiment.  We show that by thinking purely in terms of generating functions, and using a 'backwards in time' paradigm, that formulas describing various situations can be easily obtained.  This includes a generating function for Haldane's probability distribution due to Ycart.  We apply our formulas to both simulated and real data created by looking at yeast cells acquiring an immunization to the antibiotic canavanine.

Classroom Investigation in Darwinian Evolution.</A></B>
<I>American Biology Teacher, Volume 77 (8), October 2015.</I>
Microbial cultures swiftly adapt to lethal agents such as antibiotics or viruses by acquiring resistance
mutations. Does this remarkable adaptability require a Lamarckian explanation, whereby the agent
specifically directs resistance mutations? Soon after the question arose, Luria and Delbrück devised a
clever experiment, the <I>fluctuation test</I>, that answered this question in the negative: microbial adaptation,
they showed, is entirely consistent with a Darwinian explanation. Their 1943 article is a classic of biology
literature, with practical and theoretical implications that continue to expand today. Implementing an
updated fluctuation test in a college teaching lab provides a simple experimental setting in which
beginning students learn to apply basic principles of evolutionary biology and scientific reasoning, while
gaining hands-on experience in core technical advances of contemporary life science.

Suppose that \(H(q,p)\) is a Hamiltonian on a manifold \(M\), and \(\tilde L(q,\dot q)\), the Rayleigh dissipation function, satisfies the same hypotheses as a Lagrangian on the manifold \(M\).  We provide a Hamiltonian framework that gives the equations
\(\dot q  = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\),
\(\dot p = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} - \frac{\partial \tilde L}{\partial \dot q}\).
The method is to embed \(M\) into a larger framework where the motion drives a wave equation on the negative half line, where the energy in the wave represents heat being carried away from the motion.  We obtain a version of N&ouml;ther's Theorem that is valid for dissipative systems.  We also show that this framework fits the widely held view of how Hamiltonian dynamics can lead to the "arrow of time."

The purpose of this note is to see to what extent ideal gas laws can be obtained from simple Newtonian mechanics, specifically elastic collisions.  We present simple one-dimensional situations that seem to validate the laws.  The first section describes a numerical simulation that demonstrates the second law of thermodynamics.

<I>Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, <b>9,1</b>, (2014).</I>
Static equations for thin inextensible elastic rods, or <I>elastica</I> as they are sometimes called, have been studied since before the time of Euler.  In this paper, we examine how to model the dynamic behavior of elastica.  We present a fairly high speed, robust numerical scheme that uses (i) a space discretization that uses cubic splines, and (ii) a time discretization that preserves a discrete version of the Hamiltonian.  A good choice of numerical scheme is important, because these equations are very <I>stiff</I>, that is, most explicit numerical schemes will become unstable very quickly.  The authors conducted this research anticipating describing the dynamic Kirchhoff problem, that is, the behavior of general springs that have natural curvature, and for which the equations take into account torsion of the rod.

<I>Journal of Functional analysis, 267 (2014), no. 10, 3557-3579.</I>
Suppose that \(f\) is a Lipschitz function on the real numbers with Lipschitz constant smaller or equal to 1. Let \(A\) be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \(\mathcal H\). Let \(p \in (1,\infty)\) and suppose that \(x\) in \(B(\mathcal H)\) is an operator such that the commutator \([A,x]\) is contained in the Schatten class \(\mathcal S_p\). It is proved by the last two authors, that then also \([f(A),x]\) is contained in \(\mathcal S_p\) and there exists a constant \(C_p\) independent of \(x\) and \(f\) such that \({\|[f(A),x]\|}_p \le C_p {\|[A,x]\|}_p\).  The main result of this paper is to give a sharp estimate for \(C_p\) in terms of \(p\). Namely, we show that \(C_p \sim p^2/(p-1)\). In particular, this gives the best estimates for operator Lipschitz inequalities.  We treat this result in a more general setting. This involves commutators of \(n\) self-adjoint operators, for which we prove the analogous result. The case described here in the abstract follows as a special case.

<I>Composites: Part A 43 (2012) 1959-1970.</I>
Two fiber interaction models for predicting the fiber orientation and resulting stiffness of a short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite are investigated, the isotropic rotary diffusion of Folgar and Tucker (1984) and the anisotropic rotary diffusion of Phelps and Tucker (2009).  This study employs several fiber orientation tensor closure approximations for both diffusion models and results are compared to those from the numerically exact spherical harmonic approach. Results are presented for variations in the fiber orientation and the processed part stiffness. A significant difference was observed between the stiffness predicted by both rotary diffusion models. It is worth noting that not all closures behave the same between the diffusion models, thus encouraging further studies to refine and validate the new fiber interaction models and solution approaches. A study of the predicted flexural modulus is presented, and results suggest that flexural modulus experiments may aid in further refining the fiber interaction models.

<I>Proceedings of the ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress &amp; Exposition IMECE 2011 November 11-17, 2011, Denver, Colorado, USA.</I>
This paper studies the rheological properties of a semi-dilute fiber suspension for short fiber reinforced composite materials processing. For industrial applications, the volume fraction of short fibers could be large for semi-dilute and concentrated fiber suspensions. Therefore, fiber-fiber interactions consisting of hydrodynamic interactions and direct mechanical contacts could affect fiber orientations and thus the rate of fiber alignment in the manufacturing processing.  In this paper, we study the semi-dilute fiber suspensions, i.e.  the gap between fibers becomes closer, and hydrodynamic interactions becomes stronger, but the physical/mechanical contacts are still rare. We develop a three-dimensional finite element approach for simulating the motions of multiple fibers in low-Reynolds-number flows typical of polymer melt flow. We extend our earlier single fiber model to consider hydrodynamic interactions between fibers.  This approach computes the hydrodynamic forces and torques on fibers by solving governing equations of motion in fluid. The hydrodynamic forces and torques result from two scenarios: gross fluid motion and hydrodynamic interactions from other fibers. Our approach seeks fibers' velocities that zero the hydrodynamic torques and forces acting on the fibers by the surrounding fluid. Fiber motions are then computed using a Runge-Kutta approach to update fiber positions and orientations as a function of time.  This method is quite general and allows for solving multiple fiber suspensions in complex fluids. Examples with fibers having various starting positions and orientations are considered and compared with Jeffery's single fiber solution (1922). Meanwhile, we study the effect of the presence of a bounded wall on fiber motions, which is ignored in Jeffery's original work. The possible reasons why fiber motions observed in experiments align slower than those predicted by Jeffery's theory are discussed in this
paper.

<I>Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 133(5), 2011, doi:10.1115/1.4004831.</I>
This paper presents a computational approach for simulating the motion of a single fiber suspended within a viscous fluid. We develop a Finite Element Method (FEM) for modeling the dynamics of a single rigid fiber suspended in a moving fluid. Our approach seeks solutions using the Newton-Raphson method for the fiber's linear and angular velocities such that the net hydrodynamic forces and torques acting on the fiber are zero. Fiber motion is then computed with a Runge-Kutta method to update the fiber position and orientation as a function of time. Low-Reynolds-number viscous flows are considered since these best represent the flow conditions for a polymer melt within a mold cavity. This approach is first used to verify Jeffery's orbit (1922) and addresses such issues as the role of a fiber's geometry on the dynamics of a single fiber, which were not addressed in Jeffery's original work. The method is quite general and allows for fiber shapes that include, but are not limited to, ellipsoidal fibers (such as that studied in Jeffery's original work), cylindrical fibers and bead-chain fibers. The relationships between equivalent aspect ratio and geometric aspect ratio of cylindrical and other axisymmetric fibers are derived in this paper.

<I>Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, Volume 166, Issues 7-8, April 2011, Pages 343-353 .</I>
Jeffery's equation with diffusion is widely used to predict the motion of concentrated fiber suspensions in flows with low Reynold's numbers. Unfortunately, the evaluation of the fiber orientation distribution can require excessive computation, which is often avoided by solving the related second order moment tensor equation.  This approach requires a `closure' that approximates the distribution function's fourth order moment tensor from its second order moment tensor.  This paper presents the <I>Fast Exact Closure</I> (FEC) which uses conversion tensors to obtain a pair of related ordinary differential equations; avoiding approximations of the higher order moment tensors altogether.  The FEC is exact in that when diffusion is absent it exactly solves Jeffery's equation.  Numerical examples are provided with both Folgar-Tucker (1984) diffusion and the recent anisotropic rotary diffusion of Phelps and Tucker (2009).

Laplace transform is used to solve the problem of heat conduction over a finite slab. The temperature and heat flux on the two surfaces of a slab are related by the transfer functions. These relationships can be used to calculate the front surface heat input (temperature and heat flux) from the back surface measurements (temperature and/or heat flux) when the front surface measurements are not feasible to obtain. This paper demonstrates that the front surface inputs can be obtained from the sensor data without resorting to inverse Laplace transform. Through Hadamard Factorization Theorem, the transfer functions are represented as infinite products of simple polynomials. Consequently, the relationships between the front and back surfaces are translated to the time-domain without inverse Laplace transforms. These time-domain relationships are used to obtain approximate solutions through iterative procedures. We select a numerical method that can smooth the data to filter out noise and at the same time obtain the time derivatives of the data. The smoothed data and time derivatives are then used to calculate the front surface inputs.

Often a screening or selection experiment targets a cell or tissue, which presents many possible molecular targets and identifies a correspondingly large number of ligands. We describe a statistical method to extract an estimate of the complexity or richness of the set of molecular targets from competition experiments between distinguishable ligands, including aptamers derived from combinatorial experiments (SELEX or phage display). In simulations, the nonparametric statistic provides a robust estimate of complexity from a 100x100 matrix of competition experiments, which is clearly feasible in high-throughput format. The statistic and method are potentially applicable to other ligand binding situations.

<I>Proceedings of the ASME 2010 International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition IMECE 2010 November 12-18, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</I>
For stiffness predictions of short fiber reinforced polymer composites, it is essential to understand the orientation during processing. This is often performed through the equation of change of the fiber orientation tensor to simulate the fiber orientation during processing. Unfortunately this approach, while computationally efficient, requires the next higher ordered orientation tensor, thus requiring the use of a closure approximation. Many efforts have been made to develop closures to approximate the fourth-order orientation tensor in terms of the second order orientation tensor. Recently, Montgomery-Smith et al (2010) developed a pair of exact closures, one for systems with dilute suspensions and a second for dense suspensions, where the later works well for a variety of diffusion models. In this paper we compare the fiber orientation results of the Fast Exact Closure (FEC) for dense suspensions to that of the Spherical Harmonic solution, which although considered to be numerically exact does not readily lend itself to implementations in current industrial processing CFD codes. This paper focuses on a series of comparisons of material stiffness predictions between the FEC, current fitted closure models, and the spherical harmonics solution for a thin plate subjected to pure shear. Results for the select flows considered show the similarities between the current class of orthotropic fitted closures and that of the FEC. Although the results are similar between the fitted closures and the FEC, it is important to recognize that the Fast Exact Closure is formed without a fitting process. Consequently, the results are anticipated, in general, to be more robust in implementation.

<I>Proceedings of the ASME 2010 International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition IMECE 2010 November 12-18, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</I>
The kinetics of the fiber orientation during processing of short-fiber composites governs both the processing characteristics and the cured part performance. The flow kinetics of the polymer melt dictates the fiber orientation kinetics, and in turn the underlying fiber orientation dictates the bulk flow characteristics. It is beyond computational comprehension to model the equation of motion of the full fiber orientation probability distribution function. Instead, typical industrial simulations rely on the computationally efficient equation of motion of the second-order orientation tensor (also known as the second-order moment of the orientation distribution function) to model the characteristics of the fiber orientation within a polymer suspension. Unfortunately, typical implementation forms of any order orientation tensor equation of motion requires the next higher, even ordered, orientation tensor, thus necessitating a closure of the higher order expression. The recently developed Fast Exact Closure avoids the classical closure problem by solving a set of related second-order tensor equations of motion, and yields the exact solution for pure Jeffery's motion as the diffusion goes to zero. Typical closures are obtained through a fitting process, and are often obtained by fitting for orientation states obtained from solutions of the full orientation distribution function, thus tying the closure to the flows from which it was fit. With the recent understandings of the limitations of the Folgar and Tucker (1984) model of fiber interactions during processing, it has become clear the importance of developing a closure that is independent of any choice of fitting data. The Fast Exact Closure presents an alternative in that it is constructed independent of any fitting process. Results demonstrate that when diffusion exists, the solution is not only physical, but solutions for flows experiencing Folgar-Tucker diffusion are shown to exhibit an equal to or greater accuracy than solutions relying on closures developed via a curve fitting approach.

<I>Proceedings of the ASME 2010 International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition IMECE 2010 November 12-18, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</I>
This paper presents a numerical approach for calculating the single fiber motion in a viscous flow. This approach addresses such issues as the role of axis ratio and fiber shape on the dynamics of a single fiber, which was not addressed in Jeffery's original work. We develop a Finite Element Method (FEM) for modeling the dynamics of a single rigid fiber suspended in a moving fluid. Low Reynolds number viscous flows are considered since these best represent the flow conditions for a polymer melt within a mold cavity. Our approach seeks the fiber angular velocities that zero the hydrodynamic torques acting on the fiber using the Newton-Raphson method. Fiber motion is then computed with a Runge-Kutta method to update the position, i.e. the angle of the fiber as a function of time. This method is quite general and allows for fiber shapes that include, but are not limited to, ellipsoidal fibers (such as that studied in Jeffery's original work), cylindrical fibers and beads-chain fibers. The relationships between equivalent axis ratios and geometrical axis ratios for cylindrical and beads-chain fibers are derived in this paper.

This paper seeks to provide clues as to why experimental evidence for the alignment of slender fibers in semi-dilute suspensions under shear flows does not match theoretical predictions.  This paper posits that the hydrodynamic interactions between the different fibers that might be responsible for the deviation from theory, can at least partially be modeled by the coupling between Jeffery's equation and Stokes' equation.  It is proposed that if the initial data is slightly non-uniform, in that the probability distribution of the orientation has small spacial variations, then there is feedback via Stokes' equation that causes these non-uniformities to grow significantly in short amounts of time, so that the standard uncoupled Jeffery's equation becomes a poor predictor when the volume ratio of fibers to fluid is not extremely low.  This paper provides numerical evidence, involving spectral analysis of the linearization of the perturbation equation, to support this theory.

<I>Journal of Fluid Mechanics, volume 680, (2011), pp. 321-335.</I>
This paper presents an exact formula for calculating the fourth moment tensor from the second moment tensor for the three dimensional Jeffery's equation. Although this approach falls within the category of a moment tensor closure, it does not rely upon an approximation, either analytic or curve fit, of the fourth moment tensor as do the quadratic, hybrid or current orthotropic closures. This closure is orthotropic in the sense of Cintra and Tucker, or equivalently, a natural closure in the sense of Verleye and Dupret.  The existence of these explicit formulae has been asserted by previous authors, but as far as the authors know, the explicit forms have yet to be published.  The formulae involve elliptic integrals, and are valid whenever the fiber orientation tensor was isotropic at some point in time.  Finally, this paper presents the <I>Fast Exact Closure</I> (FEC), a fast and in principle exact method for solving Jeffery's equation, which does not require approximate closures, nor the computation of the elliptic integrals.

<I>Preprint.</I>
Numerical simulations of fiber orientation in short-fiber composites have relied on the Folgar and Tucker (1984) model for diffusion for over twenty years. Unfortunately, it has recently been shown that this fiber collision model tends to over-predict the rate of alignment; exposing the need for a new fundamental approach to more accurately capture fiber interactions within the melt flow. Here we present our initial work in the development of an objective directional diffusion model and a variable lambda model for fiber collisions where we modify Jeffery's model (1922) to incorporate local directionally dependent effects assumed proportional to the probability of fiber-fiber collisions. We show that our directional diffusion model performs well in extensional flows, whereas its usefulness appears limited in shearing flows.  Conversely, preliminary results from the variable lambda model in both elongational and shearing flows are quite promising and will be the focus of future investigations.

Amine modification of filamentous virions (phage particles) is widely used in phage display technology to couple small groups such as biotin or fluorescent dyes to the major coat protein pVIII. We have developed a generalized kinetic model for protein amine modification and applied it to the modification of pVIII with biotin and the near-infrared fluorophor Alexa Fluor 680. Empirically optimized kinetic parameters for the two modification reactions allow the modification level to be predicted for a wide range of virions and modifying reagent concentrations. Virions with 0.03 biotins per pVIII subunit have 50% of the maximal binding capacity for a streptavidin conjugate.

This paper extends the work of Bird, Warner, Stewart, Sorensen, Larson, Ottinger, Vukadinovic, and Forest <i>et al.</i>, who have applied Spherical Harmonics to numerically solve certain types of partial differential equations on the two-dimensional sphere. We present a systematic approach and implementation for solving such equations with efficient numerical solutions.  In particular we are able to solve a wide variety of fiber orientation equations considered before by Jeffery, Folgar and Tucker, and Koch, and include several recently introduced fiber orientation collision models. The main tools used to compute the coefficients for the Spherical Harmonic-based expansion are Rodrigues' formula and the ladder operators. We show that solutions of the Folgar-Tucker model using our new algorithm retains the accuracy of full simulations of the fiber orientation distribution function with computational efforts that are only slightly more than the Advani-Tucker orientation/moment tensor solutions commonly used in industrial applications. The spherical harmonic approach requires a computational effort of just three times that of the orientation tensor approach employing the orthotropic closure of VerWeyst, but with less than 1/1000th the computational effort of numerical solutions of the full orientation distribution function obtained using control volume methods.

<i>CMES: Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, Vol. 73, No. 1, pp. 45-76, 2011.</i>
The material point method (MPM), which is an extension from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to computational solid dynamics (CSD), is improved for the coupled CFD and CSD simulation of the zona failure response in piezo-assisted intracytoplasmic sperm injection (piezo-ICSI). To evaluate the stresses at any zona material point, a plane stress assumption is made in the local tangent plane of the membrane point, and a simple procedure is proposed to find the effective point connectivity for the orientation of the local tangent plane. With an iterative algorithm in each time step, the original MPM is improved to better simulate fluid dynamics problems involving strong shocks. The use of an Eulerian mesh for solving the momentum equations enables the MPM to automatically handle fluid-membrane interactions without requiring the interface-tracking module.  Several examples are used to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed numerical scheme for simulating three-dimensional fluid-membrane interactions. Finally, the proposed procedure is applied to the shock-induced zona failure analysis for the piezo-ICSI experiment.

This paper provides a new approach to proving generalizations of the F.&M. Riesz Theorem, for example, the result of Helson and Lowdenslager, the result of Forelli (and de Leeuw and Glicksberg), and more recent results of Yamagushi.  We study actions of a locally compact abelian group with ordered dual onto a space of measures, and consider those measures that are <i>analytic</i>, that is, the spectrum of the action on the measure is contained within the positive elements of the dual of the group.  The classical results tell us that the singular and absolutely continuous parts of the measure (with respect to a suitable measure) are also analytic.  The approach taken in this paper is to adopt the transference principle developed by the authors and Saeki in another paper, and apply it to martingale inequalities of Burkholder and Garling.  In this way, we obtain a decomposition of the measures, and obtain the above mentioned results as corollaries.

A binary number of <i>n</i> bits consists of an ordered sequence of <i>n</i> digits taken from the set {0,1}.  A sequence is said to be an unforgeable marker if all subsequences of consecutive digits starting at the left-hand end are dissimilar from the sequence of the same length which ends at the right-hand end.

We then give a connection between the tail distribution and the \(p\)th moment, and between the \(p\)th moment and the rearrangement invariant norms.

<i>J.M.A.A., <b>254</b>, (2001), 35-42.</i>
We give a comparison inequality that allows one to estimate the tail probabilities of sums of independent Banach space valued random variables in terms of those of independent <i>identically distributed</i> random variables.  More precisely, let \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) be independent Banach-valued random variables.  Let \(I\) be a random variable independent of \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) and uniformly distributed over \(\{ 1,\dots,n \}\).  Put \(\tilde X_1=X_I\), and let \(\tilde X_2,\dots,\tilde X_n\) be independent identically distributed copies of \(\tilde X_1\).  Then, \(P(\|X_1+\dots+X_n\| \ge \lambda)\le cP(\|\tilde X_1+\dots+\tilde X_n\|\ge \lambda/c)\) for all \(\lambda\ge 0\), where \(c\) is an absolute constant.

We give partial answers to the following conjecture: the natural embedding of a rearrangement invariant space \(E\) into \(L_1([0,1])\) is strictly singular if and only if \(G\) does not embed into \(E\) continuously, where \(G\) is the closure of the simple functions in the Orlicz space \(L_\Phi\) with \(\Phi(x) = \exp(x^2)-1\).

This paper gives another version of results due to Raugel and Sell, and similar results due to Moise, Temam and Ziane, that state the following: the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation on a thin 3 dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions has global regularity, as long as there is some control on the size of the initial data and the forcing term, where the control is larger than that obtainable via "small data" estimates.  The approach taken is to consider the three dimensional equation as a perturbation of the equation when the vector field does not depend upon the coordinate in the thin direction.

In this paper the theory of evolution semigroups is developed and used to provide a framework  to study the stability of general linear control systems. These include time-varying systems modeled with unbounded state-space operators acting on Banach spaces.  This approach allows one to apply the classical theory of strongly continuous semigroups to time-varying  systems.  In particular, the complex stability radius may be expressed explicitly in terms of the generator of a (evolution) semigroup.  Examples are given to show that classical formulas  for the stability radius of an autonomous Hilbert-space system fail in more general settings. Upper and lower bounds on the stability radius are provided for these general systems.  In addition, it is shown that the theory of evolution semigroups allows for a straightforward operator-theoretic analysis of internal stability as determined by classical frequency-domain and input-output operators, even for nonautonomous Banach-space systems.

Let \((f_n)\) be a mean zero vector valued martingale sequence.  Then there exist vector valued functions \((d_n)\) from \([0,1]^n\) such that \(\int_0^1 d_n(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_n = 0\) for almost all \(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\), and such that the law of \((f_n)\) is the same as the law of \((\sum_{k=1}^n d_k(x_1,\dots,x_k))\).  Similar results for tangent sequences and sequences satisfying condition (C.I.) are presented.  We also present a weaker version of a result of McConnell that provides a Skorohod like representation for vector valued martingales.

The transference theory for \(L^p\) spaces of Calderon, Coifman, and Weiss is a powerful tool with many applications to singular integrals, ergodic theory, and spectral theory of operators. Transference methods afford a unified approach to many problems in diverse areas, which before were proved by a variety of methods. 
The purpose of this paper is to bring about a similar approach to the study of measures.   Specifically, deep results in classical harmonic analysis and ergodic theory, due to Bochner, de Leeuw-Glicksberg, Forelli, and others, are all extensions of the classical F.&M. Riesz Theorem. We will show that all these extensions are obtainable via our new transference principle for spaces of measures.

A positive function on the line is called "peak-shaped" if it is positive and convex except at one point.

Hardy martingales were introduced by Garling and used to study analytic functions on the \(N\)-dimensional torus \(\mathbb T^N\), where analyticity is defined using a lexicographic order on the dual group \(\mathbb Z^N\).  We show how, by using basic properties of orders on \(\mathbb Z^N\), we can apply Garling's method in the study of analytic functions on an arbitrary compact abelian group with an arbitrary order on its dual group.  We illustrate our approach by giving a new and simple proof of a famous generalized Jensen's Inequality due to Helson and Lowdenslager.

Let \(\Sigma\) be a \(\sigma\)-algebra over \(\Omega\), and let \(M(\Sigma)\) denote the Banach space of complex measures. Consider a representation \(T_t\) for \(t\in\mathbb R\) acting on \(M(\Sigma)\). We show that under certain, very weak hypotheses, that if for a given \(\mu\in M(\Sigma)\) and all \(A\in\Sigma\) the map \(t\mapsto T_t\mu(A)\) is in \(H^\infty(\mathbb R)\), then it follows that the map $t\mapsto T_
t\mu$ is Bochner measurable. The proof is based upon the idea of the Analytic Radon Nikodym Property.  Straightforward applications yield a new and simpler proof of Forelli's main result concerning analytic measures (<i>Analytic and quasi-invariant measures, Acta Math., <b>118</b> (1967), 33--59</i>).

Let \(G\) be a locally compact abelian group whose dual group \(\Gamma\) contains a Haar measurable order \(P\).  Using the order \(P\) we define the conjugate function operator on \(L^p(G)\), \(1 \le p < \infty\), as was done by Helson.  We will show how to use Hahn's Embedding Theorem for orders and the ergodic Hilbert transform to study the conjugate function.  Our approach enables us to define a filtration of the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(G\), which in turn will allow us to introduce tools from martingale theory into the analysis on groups with ordered duals.  We illustrate our methods by  describing a concrete way to construct the conjugate function in \(L^p(G)\).  This construction is in terms of an unconditionally convergent conjugate series whose individual terms are constructed from specific ergodic Hilbert transforms.  We also present a study of the square function associated with the conjugate series.

We use transference to prove that spaces for which the Hilbert transform is bounded, i.e. \(X\in \text{HT}\), are \(\text{ACF}\) spaces.

Bounds on the Boyd indices in terms of the Matuszewska-Orlicz indices of the defining functions are given. Also, we give an example to show that the Boyd indices and Zippin indices of an Orlicz-Lorentz space need not be equal, answering a question of Maligranda.

This paper gives upper and lower bounds for moments of sums of independent random variables \((X_k)\) which satisfy the condition that \(P(|X_k| > t) = \exp(-N_k(t))\), where \(N_k\) are concave functions.  As a consequence we obtain precise information about the tail probabilities of linear combinations of independent random variables for which \(N(t) = |t|^r\) for some fixed \(0 < r \le 1\).  This complements work of Gluskin and Kwapien who have done the same for convex functions \(N\).

<I>Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. <B>119</B>, (1996), 91-101.</I>
Let \((f_n)\) and \((g_n)\) be two sequences of random variables adapted to an increasing sequence of \(\sigma\)-algebras \((\mathcal F_n)\) such that the conditional distributions of \(f_n\) and \(g_n\) given \(\mathcal F_n\) coincide, and such that the sequence \((g_n)\) is conditionally independent. Then it is known that \(\left\|\sum f_n\right\|_p \le C \left\| \sum g_n \right\|_p\) where the constant \(C\) is independent of \(p\). The aim of this paper is to extend this result to certain classes of Orlicz and rearrangement invariant spaces. This paper includes fairly general techniques for obtaining rearrangement invariant inequalities from Orlicz norm inequalities.

<I>Indiana J. <B>45</B>, (1996), 361-379.</I>
The group generated by the kinematic dynamo operator in the space of continuous divergence-free sections of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold is studied.  As shown in previous work, if the underlying Eulerian flow is aperiodic, then the spectrum of this group is obtained from the spectrum of its generator by exponentiation, but this result does not hold for flows with an open set of periodic trajectories. In the present paper, we consider Eulerian vector fields with periodic trajectories and prove the following  annular hull theorems: The spectrum of the group belongs to the annular hull of the exponent of the spectrum of the kinematic dynamo operator, that is to the union of all circles centered at the origin and intersecting this set.  Also, the annular hull of the spectrum of the group on the space of divergence free vector fields coincides with the smallest annulus, containing the spectrum of the group on the space of all continuous vector fields.  As a corollary,  the spectral abscissa of the generator coincides with the growth bound for the group.

We study evolutionary semigroups generated by a strongly continuous semi-cocycle over a locally compact metric space acting on Banach fibers. This setting simultaneously covers evolutionary semigroups arising from nonautonomuous abstract Cauchy problems and <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>-semigroups, and linear skew-product flows.  The spectral mapping theorem for these semigroups is proved. The hyperbolicity of the semigroup is related to the exponential dichotomy of the corresponding linear skew-product flow. To this end a Banach algebra of weighted composition operators is studied. The results are applied in the study of: "roughness" of the dichotomy, dichotomy and solutions of nonhomogeneous equations, Green's function for a linear skew-product flow, "pointwise" dichotomy versus "global" dichotomy, and evolutionary semigroups along trajectories of the flow.

The spectrum of the kinematic dynamo operator for an ideally conducting fluid and the spectrum of the corresponding group acting in the space of continuous divergence free vector fields on a compact Riemannian manifold are described.  We prove that the spectrum of the kinematic dynamo operator is exactly one vertical strip whose boundaries can be determined in terms of the Lyapunov-Oseledets exponents with respect to all ergodic measures for the Eulerian flow.  Also, we prove that the spectrum of the corresponding group is obtained from the spectrum of its generator by exponentiation. In particular, the growth bound for the group coincides with the spectral bound for the generator.

We present a spectral mapping theorem for continuous semigroups of operators on any Banach space \(E\). The condition for the hyperbolicity of a semigroup on \(E\) is given in terms of the generator of an evolutionary semigroup acting in the space of \(E\)-valued functions. The evolutionary semigroup generated by the propagator of a nonautonomous differential equation in \(E\) is also studied. A "discrete" technique for the investigating of the evolutionary semigroup is developed and applied to describe the hyperbolicity (exponential dichotomy) of the nonautonomuos equation.

<I>Annals Prob. <B>23</B>, (1995), 806-816.</I>
In this paper the following result, which allows one to decouple U-Statistics in tail probability, is proved in full generality.
Theorem 1. Let \(X_i\) be a sequence of independent random variables taking values in a measure space \(\mathcal S\), and let \(f_{i_1,\dots,i_k}\) be measurable functions from \(\mathcal S^k\) to a Banach space \(B\). Let \((X_i^{(j)})\) be independent copies of \((X_i)\). The following inequality holds for all \(t \ge 0\) and all \(n \ge 2\) 
\[ P\left(\left\|\sum_{1 \le i_1 \ne \cdots \ne i_k \le n} f_{i_1,\dots,i_k}(X_{i_1},\dots,X_{i_k})\right\| \ge t\right)
\le C_k
P\left(\left\|C_k \sum_{1 \le i_1 \ne \cdots \ne i_k \le n} f_{i_1,\dots,i_k}(X_{i_1}^{(1)},\dots,X_{i_k}^{(k)})\right\| \ge t\right) .\]
Furthermore, the reverse inequality also holds in the case that the functions \(\{f_{i_1,\dots,i_k}\}\) satisfy the symmetry condition
\[ f_{i_1,\dots,i_k}(X_{i_1},\dots,X_{i_k}) = f_{i_{\pi(1)},\dots,i_{\pi(k)}}(X_{i_{\pi(1)}},\dots,X_{i_{\pi(k)}}) \]
for all permutations \(\pi\) of \(\{1,\dots,k\}\). Note that the expression \(i_1 \ne \cdots \ne i_k\) means that \(i_r \ne i_s\) for \(r \ne s\). Also, \(C_k\) is a constant that depends only on \(k\).

If \(\phi\) is a submeasure satisfying an appropriate lower estimate we give a quantitative result on the total mass of a measure \(\mu\) satisfying \(0\le \mu \le \phi\).  We give a dual result for supermeasures and then use these results to investigate convexity on non-locally convex quasi-Banach lattices. We then show how to use these results to extend some factorization theorems due to Pisier to the setting of quasi-Banach spaces. We conclude by showing that if \(X\) is a quasi-Banach space of cotype two then any operator \(T:C(\Omega) \to X\) is 2-absolutely summing and factors through a Hilbert space and discussing general factorization theorems for cotype two spaces.

Let \(B\) denote an arbitrary Banach space, \(G\) a compact abelian group with Haar measure \(\mu\) and dual group \(\Gamma\). Let \(E\) be a Sidon subset of \(\Gamma\) with Sidon constant \(S(E)\). Let \(r_n\) denote the \(n\)-th Rademacher function on \([0, 1]\). We show that there is a constant \(c\), depending only on \(S(E)\), such that, for all \(\alpha>0\):
\[ c^{-1} P\left[\left|\sum a_n r_n\right| \ge c \alpha\right]

where \(a_1,\dots,a_N\) are arbitrary elements of \(B\), and \(\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_N\) are arbitrary elements of \(E\).  We prove a similar result for Sidon subsets of dual objects of compact groups, and apply our results to obtain new lower bounds for the distribution functions of scalar-valued Sidon series.  We also note that either one of the above inequalities, even in the scalar case, characterizes Sidon sets.

Orlicz-Lorentz spaces provide a common generalization of Orlicz spaces and Lorentz spaces. They have been studied by many authors, including Mastylo, Maligranda, and Kaminska. In this paper, we consider the problem of comparing the Orlicz-Lorentz norms, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be equivalent. As a corollary, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Lorentz-Sharpley space to be equivalent to an Orlicz space, extending results of Lorentz and Raynaud. We also give an example of a rearrangement invariant space that is not an Orlicz-Lorentz space.

Let \(X\), \(Y\) and \(Z\) be Banach spaces, and let \(\Pi_p(X,Y)\) \((1 \le p < \infty)\) denote the space of \(p\)-summing operators from \(Y\) to \(Z\). We show that, if \(X\) is a \(\mathcal L_\infty\)-space, then a bounded linear operator \(T:X\otimes_\epsilon Y\to Z\) is 1-summing if and only if a naturally associated operator \(T^\#:X\to \Pi_1(Y,Z)\) is 1-summing. This result need not be true if \(X\) is not a \(\mathcal L_\infty\)-space. For \(p>1\), several examples are given with \(X = C[0,1]\) to show that \(T^\#\) can be \(p\)-summing without \(T\) being \(p\)-summing. Indeed, there is an operator \(T\) on \(C[0,1]\otimes_\epsilon \ell_1\) whose associated operator \(T^\#\) is 2-summing, but for all \(N\in\mathbb N\), there exists an \(N\)-dimensional subspace \(U\) of \(C[0,1]\otimes_\epsilon \ell_1\) such that \(T\) restricted to \(U\) is equivalent to the identity operator on \(\ell_\infty^N\). Finally, we show that there is a compact Hausdorff space \(K\) and a bounded linear operator \(T:C(K) \otimes_\epsilon \ell_1 \to \ell_2\) for which \(T^\#:C(K) \to \Pi_1(\ell_1,\ell_2)\) is not 2-summing.

If \(Z\) is a quotient of a subspace of a separable Banach space \(X\), and \(V\) is any separable Banach space, then there is a Banach couple \((A_0,A_1)\) such that \(A_0\) and \(A_1\) are isometric to \(X\oplus V\), and any intermediate space obtained using the real or complex interpolation method contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to \(Z\).

Corresponding state-space formulae are widely used and well understood for the case of finite-dimensional systems. In this paper infinite-dimensional generalizations of these formulae are studied for a general class of infinite-dimensional state-space systems. In particular, it is shown that reachability and observability are carried over and that the reachability and observability gramians are preserved under this transformation. Young showed that a wide class of nonrational discrete-time transfer functions admit a balanced state-space representation. It is shown that this result carries over to the continuous-time situation via the bilinear transformation.

If you want to see tortuous mathematical writing, I can recommend my own Ph.D. thesis. Unfortunately, at the time I wrote this, I did not know much about how to communicate effectively via the written word.  Well, maybe I still don't but I am better than this.
