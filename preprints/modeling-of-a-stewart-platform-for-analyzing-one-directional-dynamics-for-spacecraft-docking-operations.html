A one-directional dynamic model of a Stewart Platform
was developed to assist NASA in analyzing the dynamic response in
spacecraft docking operations. A simplified mechanical drawing was
created, capturing the physical structure's main features. A simplified
schematic diagram was developed into a lumped mass model from the
mechanical drawing. Three differential equations were derived
according to the schematic diagram. A Simulink diagram was created
using MATLAB to represent the three equations. System parameters,
including spring constants and masses, are derived in detail from the
physical system. The model can be used for further analysis via
computer simulation in predicting dynamic response in its main
docking direction, i.e., up-and-down motion.
