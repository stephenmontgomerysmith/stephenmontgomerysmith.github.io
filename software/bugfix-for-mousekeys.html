Bugfix for Mousekeys</H1></CENTER>

Here is a bug I found.  I spent a long time tracking
this one down.  I am rather pleased about finding it.
This info has been donated to The XFree86 Project, Inc. for a post 4.0.x
release, and I have also tried to submit it to the Open Group.
The fix is at the end of the document, but first let me describe
the bug and its cause.

<p>

There is a feature called MouseKeys built into X Window.  Usually
it can be activated or deactivated by pressing the key combinations 
SHIFT-ALT-NUMLOCK.
This will enable you to move the mouse using the keypad.  The numbers
1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 move the mouse.
<p>
There is also another feature called MouseKeysAccel.  This means that
if you press one of the numeric keypads, the mouse will not only move,
but start at a slow speed, and work up to a high speed.  This feature
seems to usually be switched on.
<p>
The MouseKeysAccel has a bug in it.  You will notice that the mouse 
begins to accelerate, and then it stops accelerating.  What is causing this is the following.  When you press one
of the numeric keypad buttons, if you keep it down for a while, the
repeat key feature will start - that is, the keyboard will begin
transmitting the key again and again.
<p>
There is a similar bug, where if you press the keypad '5' key to get
a mouseclick, it autorepeats, and there is no way to control this
behavior.
<p>
When the MouseKeys part of the Xserver receives these key repeats,
it is as if you momentarily released the button, and then repressed
it.  The acceleration starts all over again.
What should happen is that these repeats should be caught.  For example,
in XFree86 this would be done by the function <code>xf86eqEnqueue</code> in 
<code>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/common/xf86Xinput.c</code>.
But this does not happen.  Why?
<p>
The answer lies in the function <code>XkbHandleActions</code> in
<code>xc/programs/Xserver/xkb/xkbActions.c</code>.
The job of this function is to take in a key, and then process it
to see if it needs any special action.  For example, if MouseKeys
is activated, then it will divert the key from doing its normal
stuff, and instead push the mouse about.
If the key is not diverted, it gets sent to the function
<code>CoreProcessKeyEvent</code> in
<code>xc/programs/Xserver/dix/events.c</code>.
<p>
Now this is where the problem comes from.  Amongst all its other
duties, it sets a bit that tells X that this key is now down.
This bit is set in an array
<code>dev->key->down</code>.
The bit set is actually <code>1<<(key&7)</code> of <code>dev->key->down[key>>3]</code>.
This information is used by <code>xf86eqEnqueue</code> so that if it gets a
key, and that bit corresponding to the key in <code>dev->key->down</code> is
set, then <code>xf86eqEnqueue</code> knows that this is a repeated key generated
by the keyboard.  Then <code>xf86eqEnqueue</code> can act appropriately, passing
or not passing it on as required.
Now, if MouseKeys is set, and a numeric keypad is pressed, the
function <code>CoreProcessKeyEvent</code> is never called, and the appropriate
bit in <code>dev->key->down</code> is not set.  Thus <code>xf86eqEnqueue</code> cannot catch
the repeated keys.

<H2>A fix</H2>
Thanks to Ivan Pascal for helping me get this right.
Also in addition to this fix is one at http://www.rehab.uiuc.edu/accessx/
